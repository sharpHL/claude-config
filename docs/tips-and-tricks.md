# Claude Code Tips and Tricks

Productivity tips and hidden gems for working with Claude Code.

## üöÄ Productivity Boosters

### 1. Parallel Tool Calls
Claude Code can execute multiple independent operations simultaneously:

```
Please do these in parallel:
- Run the test suite
- Check for outdated dependencies
- Analyze bundle size
```

### 2. Context-Rich Requests
Provide context for better results:

```
In this React + TypeScript project using Redux:
Add a new feature for user notifications with:
- Redux slice for state management
- React component with TypeScript types
- Unit tests using Jest
- Following our existing patterns in src/features/
```

### 3. Reference Existing Code
Point to examples in your codebase:

```
Create a new API endpoint for products,
similar to how we handle users in src/api/users.ts
```

## üéØ Advanced Techniques

### Chain Commands
Use slash commands to create workflows:

```
/security-audit
# After reviewing results:
/refactor-code src/auth/
# After refactoring:
/generate-docs
```

### Custom Workflows with Hooks
Create pre-commit hooks to ensure quality:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "preCommit": {
      "command": "npm test && npm run lint",
      "description": "Run tests and linting before commit"
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Combinations
Combine multiple agents for comprehensive reviews:

```
1. Use debugging-expert to find the memory leak
2. Then use code-review-specialist to review the fix
```

## üí° Smart Shortcuts

### 1. Quick Analysis
Instead of reading files manually:
```
What does the authentication flow look like in this codebase?
```

### 2. Pattern Detection
Find architectural patterns:
```
Find all API endpoints and show me their authentication patterns
```

### 3. Dependency Insights
```
Show me all the places where we use lodash and suggest native alternatives
```

## üîß Configuration Tips

### Project-Level Settings
Create `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "preferredLanguage": "TypeScript",
  "testFramework": "Jest",
  "codeStyle": "Airbnb",
  "plugins": {
    "cc-toolkit": {
      "enabled": true,
      "autoReview": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Preferences
Set up global preferences in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# My Preferences

- Always use TypeScript for new JavaScript projects
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Include error handling in all async functions
- Write tests for all new features
- Use descriptive variable names
```

## üé® Code Generation Tips

### 1. Be Specific About Style
```
Generate a React component using:
- Functional component with hooks
- TypeScript with strict types
- CSS modules for styling
- Props interface defined separately
- JSDoc comments for complex functions
```

### 2. Request Multiple Approaches
```
Show me 3 different ways to implement user authentication:
1. JWT-based
2. Session-based
3. OAuth 2.0

Include pros and cons for each
```

### 3. Ask for Alternatives
```
This code works but seems inefficient.
Can you suggest a more performant approach?
```

## üîç Debugging Shortcuts

### Quick Stack Trace Analysis
```
Here's the error stack trace:
[paste stack trace]

What's causing this and how do I fix it?
```

### Environment Debugging
```
The app works locally but fails in production.
Help me debug environment-specific issues.
```

### Performance Profiling
```
This endpoint is slow. Profile it and suggest optimizations:
[paste endpoint code]
```

## üìö Documentation Tricks

### Auto-Generate from Code
```
Generate API documentation from these endpoint files:
src/api/**/*.ts
```

### Update Existing Docs
```
The authentication flow changed.
Update docs/auth.md to reflect the new flow.
```

### Create Examples
```
Add usage examples to the README for:
- Installation
- Basic usage
- Advanced configuration
```

## üß™ Testing Strategies

### Generate Test Cases
```
Write comprehensive tests for this function:
- Happy path
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Mock external dependencies
```

### Test Coverage Analysis
```
Check test coverage and identify untested code paths
```

### E2E Test Scenarios
```
Create E2E tests for the checkout flow:
1. Add items to cart
2. Apply discount code
3. Complete payment
4. Verify order confirmation
```

## üîí Security Quick Checks

### Fast Security Scan
```
Quick security check:
- Scan for hardcoded secrets
- Check authentication on all routes
- Verify input validation
```

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
```
Check all dependencies for security vulnerabilities
and suggest safe alternatives for any risky packages
```

## üéØ Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Common Logic
```
Find duplicated code across these files:
src/components/**/*.tsx

Suggest how to extract it into shared utilities
```

### Modernize Code
```
Update this code to use modern JavaScript features:
- Convert callbacks to async/await
- Use destructuring
- Apply optional chaining
```

### Design Pattern Application
```
This code could benefit from a design pattern.
Which pattern would work best and how would you implement it?
```

## üìä Analysis Techniques

### Codebase Overview
```
I'm new to this project. Give me:
1. Architecture overview
2. Key files and their purposes
3. Common workflows
4. How to get started
```

### Dependency Analysis
```
Analyze our dependencies:
- Which are outdated?
- Which have security issues?
- Which could be replaced with lighter alternatives?
```

### Performance Hotspots
```
Find performance bottlenecks:
- Slow database queries
- N+1 problems
- Inefficient algorithms
- Large bundle sizes
```

## üîÑ Git Integration

### Smart Commits
```
Review my staged changes and suggest a good commit message
```

### Branch Comparison
```
Compare feature/new-auth with main and summarize the changes
```

### Merge Conflict Resolution
```
Help me resolve these merge conflicts:
[paste conflict]
```

## üåü Pro Tips

### 1. Use Agents Proactively
Don't wait for problems - use agents regularly:
- Code review before every PR
- Performance audit weekly
- Security scan before releases

### 2. Build a Command Library
Create custom commands for your common tasks:
- `/deploy-staging`
- `/run-full-test-suite`
- `/generate-migration`

### 3. Leverage Context
Keep relevant documentation in your project:
- Architecture decisions in `docs/architecture/`
- API specs in `docs/api/`
- Setup guides in `docs/setup/`

### 4. Iterative Refinement
Start broad, then refine:
```
# First pass
Create a user authentication system

# Refinement
Add 2FA support using TOTP
Add remember me functionality
Implement rate limiting
```

### 5. Learn from Generated Code
Ask Claude Code to explain its decisions:
```
Why did you choose this approach over [alternative]?
```

## üéì Advanced Patterns

### Composition
```
1. First, create the data model
2. Then, create the API layer
3. Next, create the service layer
4. Finally, create the UI components
```

### Validation Loops
```
Create a validation function, then:
- Write tests for it
- Review the tests
- Refine based on review
- Update documentation
```

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Start with a basic implementation
Then add: error handling, logging, caching, monitoring
```

## üìà Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
Schedule regular codebase reviews:
```
Weekly: /analyze-project
Monthly: /security-audit
Quarterly: Full refactoring assessment
```

### Knowledge Capture
Document learnings:
```
Create a troubleshooting guide based on:
- Common errors we've encountered
- Their solutions
- Prevention strategies
```

### Automation Opportunities
Identify repetitive tasks:
```
What tasks do I do repeatedly that could be automated?
Create slash commands for them.
```
