## üìã Contribution Process

### Step 1: Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cc-toolkit.git
cd cc-toolkit
```

### Step 2: Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

#### Adding a Slash Command
1. Create a new `.md` file in `commands/`
2. Add frontmatter with description and tags
3. Write a clear, focused command prompt
4. Test it locally

Example:
```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
parameters:
  - name: param1
    description: Parameter description
    required: false
---

Your command prompt here...
```

#### Adding an Agent
1. Create a new `.md` file in `agents/`
2. Define agent metadata in frontmatter
3. Document capabilities and approach
4. Specify tools the agent uses
5. Provide usage examples

Example:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: What this agent does
tools: [Read, Write, Grep, Bash]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

Agent instructions here...
```

#### Improving Documentation
1. Edit the relevant `.md` file
2. Ensure formatting is consistent
3. Add examples where helpful
4. Check for broken links

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

#### Local Testing
```bash
# Create a test marketplace configuration
# In your Claude Code settings:
{
  "pluginMarketplaces": [
    {
      "name": "local-test",
      "url": "file:///path/to/cc-toolkit/parent"
    }
  ]
}

# Install the plugin
/plugin install cc-toolkit@local-test

# Test your changes
# Try the new command or agent
# Verify it works as expected
```

#### Quality Checks
- [ ] Command/agent works as intended
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: new performance profiling command"
# or
git commit -m "Fix: typo in security-audit command"
# or
git commit -m "Docs: improve usage examples"
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `Add:` - New feature or component
- `Fix:` - Bug fix
- `Docs:` - Documentation changes

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Changes work locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] No unnecessary files included
- [ ] Follows existing style/format

### Example PR Description
```markdown
## Add Performance Profiling Command

### What
Adds a new `/profile-performance` command that analyzes application performance and provides optimization recommendations.

### Why
Many developers need to profile their applications but don't have a systematic approach. This command provides a structured workflow.

### How to Test
1. Install the plugin locally
2. Run `/profile-performance` in a test project
3. Verify it analyzes performance metrics
4. Check that recommendations are actionable

### Changes
- New command: `commands/profile-performance.md`
- Updated README with command documentation
- Added usage example to `examples/usage-examples.md`

Fixes #42
```
